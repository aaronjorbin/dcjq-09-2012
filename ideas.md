We all have a workflow. In fact we all have many of them.  Human beings are creatures of habit. In Thinking Fast and Slow, Nobel lauriate  Daniel Kahneman describes our use of intuition to remember the steps in our workflows and the order of our workflows. When we wake up, we get out of bed, make our way to the bathroom, brush our teeth, perhaps shower and then make a bowl of oatmeal. All of this come natural and we do it by thinking fast, by retracing the steps we've done hundreds of times before. We don't slow down to think "Should I use the toilet or the sink". We've trained our body to follow a workflow. My goal today is for you to understand how to look at your workflow to find ways to achieve the same sense of self automation in your development that you achieve in your morning rutean. I'm going to explore how to take a look at your workflow to find points for automation, talk about some tools that you might be able to use to speed up your workflows and do your automation and close with some broader ideas.
