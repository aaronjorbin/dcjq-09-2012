Random things that I might use

We all have a workflow. In fact we all have many of them.  Human beings are creatures of habit. In Thinking Fast and Slow, Nobel lauriate  Daniel Kahneman describes our use of intuition to remember the steps in our workflows and the order of our workflows. When we wake up, we get out of bed, make our way to the bathroom, brush our teeth, perhaps shower and then make a bowl of oatmeal. All of this come natural and we do it by thinking fast, by retracing the steps we've done hundreds of times before. We don't slow down to think "Should I use the toilet or the sink". We've trained our body to follow a workflow. My goal today is for you to understand how to look at your workflow to find ways to achieve the same sense of self automation in your development that you achieve in your morning rutean. I'm going to explore how to take a look at your workflow to find points for automation, talk about some tools that you might be able to use to speed up your workflows and do your automation and close with some broader ideas.

So how do we speed things up?  The answer lies in looking at what we do of ton and using tools to redecue the redundancy, repetition and reliance on remembering what it is we need to do next.  .

The first step is going to be to actively figure out what you do, in what order you do it, and what are the common groups of tasks you do.  As I mentioned in the begging, we all have many work flows, therefore what you are trying to do is find the commonly grouped actions since those are your simple workflows.

If you are are developing on the command line, you have handy program that will help you called history. 

This leads to a good lesson.  dot file all the things. You can work faster if your tools and programs are working for you.  Almost every command line tool
